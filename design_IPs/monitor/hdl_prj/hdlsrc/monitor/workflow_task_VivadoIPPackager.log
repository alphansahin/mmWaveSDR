INFO: [ProjectBase 1-489] The host OS only allows 260 characters in a normal path. The project is stored in a path with more than 80 characters. If you experience issues with IP, Block Designs, or files not being found, please consider moving the project to a location with a shorter path. Alternately consider using the OS subst command to map part of the path to a drive letter.
Current project path is 'C:/Dropbox/Work/Project_mmWaveSDR_AERPAW/IPs/monitor/hdl_prj/ipcore/monitor_v1_0/prj_ip'

WARNING: [IP_Flow 19-3656] If you move the project, the path for repository 'c:/Dropbox/Work/Project_mmWaveSDR_AERPAW/IPs/monitor/hdl_prj/ipcore' may become invalid. A better location for the repository would be in a path adjacent to the project.
